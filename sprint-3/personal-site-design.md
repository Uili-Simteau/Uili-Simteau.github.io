* What is my site's purpose?

To document, and promote, my journey as a Web Developer extraodinair.

* Who is my target audience?

Potential employers, and future Dev students.

* How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?

I'd like them to enjoy the experience. 'Joy' to be a key communication point. Fun, humorous without being annoying. Beautiful images, engaging visuals, yet not too distracting from the content.

* How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?

Simple structure, optimised images, translucent backgrounds, logical flow of hierarchy. I'd like a floating menu bar, and a muted background image.

This will also be a platform for my photographic playing around, which will communicate some of my playfulness.
