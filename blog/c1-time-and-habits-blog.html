                  <p>I've used a bit of the Pomodoro technique to block my time and to enforce breaks and stretching routines. Working so far!</p>
                  <p>I've also done a little bit of Fogg's technique in terms of getting into a habit of excercising while I'm coding. I try to do five push-ups while i'm on the stairs, each time I go up to my office to study. A little start. I had a physical job before the course, so I didn't really need to 'work out'. But now I'll have to try to fit it in where I can.</p>
                  <p>I think both these techniques are working quite well. I may have to shorten my time frames from 45 min to 25, and I'll slowly increase the push up count :)</p>
