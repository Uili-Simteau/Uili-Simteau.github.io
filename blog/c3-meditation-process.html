      <p><strong>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way I tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</strong></p>
      <p>I had to let go of trying to get the look 'just right'.</p>
      <p>I screwed up a couple of things, and had to throw a couple of things out the window and start again. But I think it has given me a better understanding of how some things work.</p>
      <p>I had to focus on what process I was doing rather than the end product.</p>

      <p><strong>What Did I think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</strong></p>
      <p>I've always thought meditation has been beneficial. It has always seemed quite hard to maintain focus though.</p>
      <p><strong>What new things have you learnt about mediation?</strong></p>
      <p>The concept of happiness being the mind's default state, and experiencing happiness was to be 'allowed' rather than 'pursued', was interesting.</p>
      <p>I also found it helpful to see it as exercises, to be improved upon instead of being great at straight away.</p>
      <p><strong>Did any of the suggested mediation techniques stand out to you?</strong></p>
      <p>The four step method of maintaining focus seemed good. Acknowledging, experience without judging, react with mindfulness and letting go.</p>
      <p><strong>Any other musings?</strong></p>
      <p>I'm encouraged to pursue this practice more and more as a life long enquiry.</p>  </div>
