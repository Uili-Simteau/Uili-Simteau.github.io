      <p><strong>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</strong>
        <p>My wife is a trained counsellor, so this is just her normal practice really. It was like taking her to suck eggs when i described it to her :). I learnt how to actively listen though. Applying the meditation focus technique is a game changer though.</p>
        <p>My wife likes to use it with our children, reflecting etc. but we both could practice actively listening, and dipping for sure.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p><strong>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</strong></p>
        <p>The active listening, through using the meditation focus is a keeper in my mind.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p><strong>Any other musings?</strong></p>
        <p>Talking this through with a family member who has some intermittent anxiety lapses has been really valuable. The concept of just doing one mindful breath a day feels achievable, rather than another practice to fail at.</p>
        <p>This is life changing stuff really. Thank you.</p>  </div>
