        <p><strong>How does Javascript compare to HTML and CSS?</strong></p>
        <p>It feels more complex for sure! loops and syntax do my head in. camelCode format took little to get used to.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth’.</strong></p>
        <p>Control flow is the process by which decisions and actions are carried out in the code, and in what order.</p>
        <p> You wouldn’t brush your teeth before waking up in the morning would you? You would also keep brushing, until each tooth has been brushed (hopefully).</p>
        <p>Control statements determine the control and flow of processes the code is calling.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals.</strong></p>
        <p>Accessing data from arrays is done with square bracket notation, where the item of data is located within the array by its’ position in the array: for example, the second item in myArray would be called => myArray[1].</p>
        <p>Accessing data from object literals is done by using dot notation: for an myObject {“shoe”: “boot”}, you could use
myObject.shoe, this would return “boot”; or you could use square bracket notation like this: myObject[“shoe”] to return the same.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>Explain what functions are and why they are useful</strong></p>
        <p>Functions save us time by using code that can be used repeatedly, using different inputs and parameters.</p>
