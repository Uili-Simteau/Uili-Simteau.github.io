      <p>My take on the EDA experience so far is one of an opportunity to strike out, and do something difficult and awesome. That is, that it's awesome because it's difficult.</p>
      <p>I tell my 7 and 9 year old daughters that the 'secret to life' halves your disappointment and doubles your happiness... The secret that I share with them is... 'Life is Hard'.</p>
      <P>After the frown on their face passes, I explain that if you accept that life is hard, then you're not surpirsed when things don't go the way you planned. Your disappointment is halved.</P>
      <p>When things do go your way, Awesome! you know how hard that little victory, or twist of fortune, was to come by, because 'life is hard'.</p>
      <p>EDA is, and going to increasingly be, hard. That makes the journey even better (I hope).</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>My impressions are that the coaches seem nice, supportive and knowledgible.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>My cohort felt large and a bit intimidating to begin with, but my Roa Tahi sub-group seem cool and I'm looking forward to getting to know them better.</p>
      <p>Working from home seems daunting, balancing family life and study. But the fact that this is a crucial job transition, and more and more 'life changing' transition, that alone is quite a good motivator for me.</p>

      <p>I feel I'm going to engage with this culture quite well.<P>
        <p>I'm creative and extrovert by nature, and I hope these attributes add to people's journey around me.</P>
          <p></p>
          <p>I think my expectations of EDA changed a little after watching the video, but it changed most when I had my initial 'interview' with Rohan.</p>
          <p>I asked him what kind of questions will be in the interview. He said 'That's up to you, I'll be the one answering your questions.' I was in the driver's seat.</p>
          <p>The quality of the interview depended on the quality of 'my' questions. My expectations of EDA depends on the expectations I place on myself I'm starting to think.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>I'm both excited and nervous to participate in this learning environment. Excited for the growth in myself and in my fellow cohort-ies; nervous about multiple acts of failure that I'll have to become comfortable with.</p>
