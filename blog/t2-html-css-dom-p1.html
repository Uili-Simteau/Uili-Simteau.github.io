                  <li>An analogy for HTML, CSS and DOM?</li>
                  <p>
                    A good anaogy is that of a house really. HTML is the structure of the house, how many rooms will there be? Where are the doors? Foundations?  How many windows are there?</p>
                  <p>CSS is like the decoration for the house: what colour are the walls? carpet on the floors? paintings and photos on the walls?
                  </p>
                  <p>DOM (Document Object Model) is like looking at the architect's blueprints for the house, with notes from the interior designer. </p>
                  <li>What does 'boxifying' design?</li>
                  <p>That means looking at a web page, or proposed dsesign for a webpage, and cutting it up in to smaller and smaller boxes.</p>
                  <p>This helps with understanding the structure you might want to follow when writing the HTML (structural) code for the site.</p>
                  <li>That is the Box Model</li>
                  <p>This is the term used for the process of boxifying described above. Treating the HTML pages on the internet as just a whole collection of big and small boxes.</p>
