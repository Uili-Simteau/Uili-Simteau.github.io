                <ul>
                    <li>What learnings did I take from the chapter?
                    </li>
                      <p>The links between emotions and the body were probably the most intersting for me. How paying attention to our body heightens our ability to excert control over our emotions.</p>
                      <p>I particularly liked the quote from Viktor Frankl, adapted to the book: '"Between stimulus and responsr, there is a space. In that space lies our freedom and our power to choose our response. In out response lies our growth and our happiness." What a mind of calmness and clarity does is to increase that space for us.'</p>
                      <p>The structure of the approach feels intuitive also. Attention to one's inner workings, holistically through the mind and body, branching out to interpersonal machinations. Loing forward to more!</p>
                      <p>The 'learnability' of EI is an encouraging aspect I've found. With training, we can become more adept and responsive to self-awareness, and awareness of others and their needs.</p>
                      <p>Self-awareness as a means of being able to 'discern the stories from reality' seems useful, to say the least.</p>
                      <p>The last point I'll bring attention to is the idea of 'happiness' being a bi-product of mindfulness is also very appealing.</p>
                      <p>Happiness was measured in some studies as the brain running in optimal form, bedded in the left prefrontal quartex. Suppression of our Amigdula based 'lizard brain' response, straight to our gut, is something I will try to put as much practice in to as my touch typing! </p>
                    <li>
                      How did I find the two minutes of mindfulness?
                    </li>
                      <p>I found it lovely. I began to sense in the middle of it a letting go of the past and of the future, or perceptions of them anyway. The world and all it's competing distractions was never very far away.</p>
